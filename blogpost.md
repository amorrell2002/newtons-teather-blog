# Getting Started with GodotXR
The making of the VR Demo for the game "Newtons Tether" which is still in development

*Author: Alex Morrell*

### Key Technologies
- [Godot XR Tools](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/xr/introducing_xr_tools.html)
- NASA Textures compiled by [Solar System Scope](https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/)
- [GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html)

## Game Concept
I have always been facinated by the amazingly intricate complexity of Solar System orreries:

The movement of the celestial bodies in and of itself is mesmerizing.
However there are some clear limitations as a result of being a clockwork construction, the main being it is not dynamic.
The planets are just there, always orbiting on the same plane, with the same period.

We have computers, why settle for gears?

Lets play god.

#### A VR Orbital Playground
The player is positioned as the "architect" of the solar system, with the celestial objects appearing as small spherical bodies.
The sun is roughly the size of a basketball, with earth being baseball sized.

The goal of the game is to put the planet into orbit by slapping the planet with enough force to not fall into the sun, but less than escape velocity. 
Gamification can be achieved by providing hoops positioned around the sun that the planet must fall through (although this has yet to be implemented).

## Development
